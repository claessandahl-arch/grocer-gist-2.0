# TODO

## Fixed Bugs ✅

- [x] **"Sök liknande grupper" timeout fixed** (PR #2)
  - Reduced batch size from 200 → 75 groups to prevent Gemini API timeout
  - Groups sorted by product count to prioritize larger groups

## Known Bugs 🐛

- [ ] **54 products still unmapped**
  - These were never mapped in the old system
  - Can run auto-map to fix

- [ ] **Receipt images on old storage**
  - Images still point to old Lovable Storage URLs
  - Will work until that bucket is deleted
  - Consider migrating images to new storage bucket

---

## Future Improvements 🚀

### Minor Cleanup

- [ ] Remove console.log statements from `ProductManagement.tsx`
- [ ] Add TypeScript types for database views (currently using `any`)

### Structured Parsing (January 2026)

- [x] **ICA Kvantum structured parser** - Fixed! Now supports ICA Kvantum, Nära, Maxi, Supermarket with 94% pass rate
- [x] **Pantretur validation logging** - Added warning when math doesn't match (PR #18)
- [ ] **Refactor hash saving flow** - Save hash AFTER receipt creation to prevent orphaned hashes on 429 errors
- [ ] **Add retry logic for rate limits** - Exponential backoff for Gemini 429 errors

**Known parser limitations** (documented, won't fix):
- Bundle discounts can result in negative item prices (totals correct)
- Bundle offer names (e.g. "4F25") may append to product names
- Some Pantretur totals don't match unit × qty

**📋 Full details**: See [`docs/AAA_PARSING_TRAINING.md`](docs/AAA_PARSING_TRAINING.md)

### Optional Enhancements

- [x] **Dev Toolbar for hidden route navigation** ⭐
  - Floating panel in bottom-right corner showing all routes
  - Only visible in development mode (`import.meta.env.PROD` check)
  - Keyboard shortcut: `⌘+Shift+D` to toggle visibility
  - Implemented in `src/components/DevToolbar.tsx`
  
- [ ] Custom domain via Vercel Domains
- [ ] Migrate receipt images to new Supabase storage bucket
