# Reference Documentation

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: EXAMPLE CONTENT** ⚠️

The files in this directory are **examples** taken from a reference project (a Budget App) to demonstrate the types of documentation that are useful for AI agents.

**When setting up a new project:**
1. **Review** these files to understand the structure and depth expected.
2. **Keep** generic files if they apply (e.g., `WORKFLOW.md`, `CODING_STANDARDS.md` - but verify they match your project).
3. **Delete** project-specific files (e.g., `BANK_SYNC_STRATEGY.md`, `GOOGLE_AUTH_SETUP.md`, `supabase-patterns.md`).
4. **Update** core documentation:
   - `TECH_STACK.md`: Replace with your actual stack.
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md`: Describe your system's architecture.
   - `UI_STYLE_GUIDE.md`: Define your specific design tokens and components.

**Goal:** This folder should eventually contain only the "source of truth" documents relevant to *your* specific project.
